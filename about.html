        <p>Hello! I'm a Information Science student at <strong>RVITM College</strong>, currently in my placement preparation phase with a CGPA of <strong>8.45</strong>. I'm passionate about technology and love solving real-world problems through coding.</p>
        <p>I'm currently exploring web development, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy creating clean, functional, and user-friendly designs.</p>
        <p>My ultimate goal is to grow into a full-stack developer, building impactful applications that improve people's lives. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading books, playing strategy games, and staying curious about new tech trends!</p>
